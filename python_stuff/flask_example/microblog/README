### Create a virtual environment for ###

$ virtualenv [name]

You will end up with a folder named [name] that contains a complete Python environment ready to be used for this project.

Virtual environments can be activated and deactivated, if desired. An activated environment adds the location of its bin folder to the system path, so that for example, when you type python you get the environment's version and not the system's one. But activating a virtual environment is not necessary, it is equally effective to invoke the interpreter by specifying its pathname.
